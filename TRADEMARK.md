# TruePulse Trademark Policy

## Overview

"TruePulse" and the TruePulse logo are trademarks owned by TruePulse. This policy explains how you may use these trademarks.

## What You CAN Do

✅ **Use the name to refer to TruePulse**
- "This application is built on TruePulse"
- "Compatible with TruePulse"
- "Powered by TruePulse (modified)"

✅ **Fork and modify the code** under AGPL terms, but you must:
- Use a different name for your project
- Clearly indicate your version is modified
- Not imply official endorsement

✅ **Contribute to the official project** - contributors retain their copyright but grant license under AGPL

## What You CANNOT Do

❌ **Market a product or service as "TruePulse"**
- You cannot call your hosted service "TruePulse"
- You cannot sell "TruePulse Enterprise" without permission

❌ **Use the TruePulse logo** without written permission

❌ **Imply official affiliation** where none exists

❌ **Register domain names** containing "TruePulse" for competing services

## Examples

| Scenario | Allowed? |
|----------|----------|
| Fork the code and call it "MyPollApp" | ✅ Yes |
| Fork the code and call it "TruePulse Pro" | ❌ No |
| Write a blog post about TruePulse | ✅ Yes |
| Offer "TruePulse hosting services" | ❌ No |
| Say "Based on TruePulse (modified)" | ✅ Yes |
| Use TruePulse logo on your website | ❌ No (without permission) |

## Naming Your Fork

If you create a modified version, please choose a distinct name such as:
- "[YourCompany] Pulse"
- "[YourBrand] Polling Platform"
- Any name that doesn't include "TruePulse"

## Requesting Permission

For trademark licensing inquiries or permission requests, please open an issue in this repository or contact the maintainers.

## Rationale

This policy exists to:
1. Prevent user confusion about official vs. unofficial versions
2. Protect the reputation of the TruePulse project
3. Allow the community to build on this work while maintaining brand clarity

This trademark policy works alongside the AGPL license. The AGPL governs your rights to the code; this policy governs use of the TruePulse name and logo.
